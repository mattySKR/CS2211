Software Tools and Systems Programming

# Description

Intro to software tools and systems level programming. Understanding how programs run 
(compilation, linking, and loading), an introduction to a complex operating system (UNIX), 
scripting languages, and the C programming language. System calls, memory management, libraries, 
multi-component program organization and builds, version control, debuggers and profilers.

  editors; shells; I/O redirection; UNIX concurrency (processes); utilities; file permissions and security; 
  regular expressions; shell programming.

* C programming: 
 
  Compiling, linking and loading; data types and operators; control structures; formatted I/O; file I/O; 
  connections between I/O and the underlying operating system; function calls; structs; enumerations; arrays; 
  pointers (pointer arithmetics, pointers and arrays, arrays of pointers, pointers to functions); memory management; 
  linked lists and other dynamically allocated data structures; strings; calling C from UNIX; general libraries; 
  standard libraries and headers; the C preprocessor; C program organization.
